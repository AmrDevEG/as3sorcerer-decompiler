A repository providing access to and information about AS3 Sorcerer, a powerful decompiler for Adobe Flash `.swf` files.



## About AS3 Sorcerer

AS3 Sorcerer is a desktop application designed for developers, researchers, and hobbyists working with Adobe Flash technology. Its primary function is to reverse-engineer SWF files, converting them back into readable and well-structured ActionScript 3.0 (AS3) source code.

This tool is incredibly useful for:
-   Recovering lost source code.
-   Learning from existing Flash applications and games.
-   Analyzing the inner workings of a SWF file for security or interoperability purposes.

## Key Features

-   **Full AS3 Decompilation:** Converts compiled ActionScript 3.0 bytecode back into human-readable `.as` source files.
-   **Asset Extraction:** Allows you to view and save embedded assets like images (JPG, PNG), sounds (MP3), fonts, and sprites.
-   **Intuitive GUI:** Features a straightforward graphical user interface that makes it easy to open files and navigate the decompiled project structure.
-   **Code Inspector:** Provides a detailed view of the SWF's internal structure, including its tags and metadata.
-   **Formatted Output:** The decompiled code is neatly formatted with syntax highlighting, making it easy to read and understand.
